## Lethal temperature tests prior to experiment

**Objective**: To investigate the duration at 44C required to elicit 
mortality over time, our goal is to yield a curve over several days to 
detect differences between priming treatments. A threshold of moderate and slow (eventually total) mortality 
is suitable for our experiment

'Lethal_temperature_test_Logger1.csv'

* top tray for the 44C challenge

* top tray in the broodstock room, relevant data is the high temperature challenge *only*
after the challenge, all cups (with oysters) were positioned on the second tray below where logger #2 was tracking temperature

Lethal_temperature_test_Logger2.csv'

* second tray for the ambient common garden 20C tracking of mortality

* data records of number dead individuals in each cup were completed on this tray with a spray bar to each cup

* ambient water from 20C head tank gravity fed this system without heat

## Experiment 

'20251024_Logger1, Logger 3, Logger 4'

* hobo logger data throughout the priming and experiment exposures

* logger ID (1-4) represents the trough number, each holding 10-12 downwellers

* logger 1 
	
	- trough closest to the courtyard door and header tanks
	- location of all the 72-hour prime downwellers during the priming phase (N = 9), first hobo to have a ramped up temperature during the priming phase
	- location of a few 24-hour prime downwellers (N=3), the remaning were in trough #2 hobo #2
	- location of the 44C challenge after 24 hour recovery post prime
	- location of the 44C challenge after 1 week recovery post prime

* logger 2
	
	- location of 6/9 24-hour downwellers during the prime phase, second hobo to have a ramped up temperature
	- location of the 44C challenge after 3 weeks of recovery post prime

* logger 3

	- location of the 6-hour downwellers during the prime phase


* logger 4

	- ambient throughput, never experiences a prime or challenge in this trough
