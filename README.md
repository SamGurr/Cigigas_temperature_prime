# Cgigas_temperature_prime

## About: 

Understanding how to elicit advantageous acclimatory effects (*intra*generational), and the longevity of these responses 
is critical to rationalize employing dose-dependent challenges in a commercial setting. OSU has a continuing parternship with 
breeding programs to leverage diverse Pacific oyster seed to test the effectiveness and variability of "priming" across families. 

In this study, our goal to to test the longevity of a sublethal encounter. 
Following primary literature, we chose temperature targets representative of the *pejus* intensity 
and varied duration of exposure to track subseqent response to a *pessimum* condition known to cause mortality. 

Our efforts will link *in vivo* physiology, transciption, and epigenetic markers to characterize temperature priming.
